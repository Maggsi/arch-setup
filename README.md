# arch-setup
Files and Info i need for setting up my Arch Linux (or Linux in general) environment

This repo includes, in no particular order, my notes and lists of programs or files i might need for my Installation of Arch-Linux.
By no means is this meant to be a guide or anything, it's just a place for me to gather my thoughts and have them accessible for when i need them in the future.


# To-Do

1. Learn how to write a README
